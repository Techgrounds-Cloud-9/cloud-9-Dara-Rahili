## Key terminology


1. SSH: The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
2. CLI: A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a command-line interface (CLI) to receive commands from a user in the form of lines of text.
3. VM: A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.
4. Type 1 hypervisor: A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware, and it's referred to as a bare-metal hypervisor.

## Overcome Challenges

I have Ubuntu on my machine so I was thinking I could use it for this purpose but couldn't find the right commands to make the remote connection. Then I got some help from my teamate who used command prompt which works fine. For adding the port correctly I just googled it.

## Results


I made a remote connection to my container using SSH. The username, ip address, and the key have been already provided by the coach.
I typed *whomai* command in the terminal and it showed me my username.
