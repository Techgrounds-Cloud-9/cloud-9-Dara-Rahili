### Create a document with VS Code.

## Key terminology


1. Markup language: Markup language refers to a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.
2. Markdown: Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc.
3. WYSIWYM: What You See Is What You Mean is a paradigm for editing a structured document. It is an adjunct to the better-known WYSIWYG paradigm, which displays the result of a formatted document as it will appear on screen or in printâ€”without showing the descriptive code underneath.

## Overcome Challenges

My main challenge was to insert an image into the markdown file.
One of my teamates gave a code which works fine but when I googled I found out that I can also easily drag and drop it (shift) into the editor.

## Results


I created a markdown file in VS Code and then pushed it into repository.
