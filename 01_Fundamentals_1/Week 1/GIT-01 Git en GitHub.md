# Git and GitHub

### On GitHub, I can share a project with my colleagues or anyone else on the web. We can work simultaneously on the project on our systems or on the platform and frequently update the results without missing anything. All our steps of work are saved and we can retrieve our previous stage of work easily.

## Key terminology


1. DevOps tool
2. Source Code Management
3. Open-Source
4. Repository: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.
5. Command Line Interface (CLI)
6. Branch: Branches isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
7. Commit: A commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.
8. Push / Pull: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
9. Merge: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.
10. Fork: A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.

## Overcome Challenges

My main challenge was to understand the main concept of using Git and GitHub and what is the difference. I watch a couple of videos and read about the whole idea. After that I have some problems in using commands in git bash which I googled it and asked my team.
